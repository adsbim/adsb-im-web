# About the ADSB Feeder Image project

One of the things that always seemed really hard when it comes to setting up an ADSB feeder is that very first step. How do you get started?

Most of the existing instructions are written for people who are familiar with computers, happy to edit config files, and comfortable working on the command line. At the same time, that obviously is just a small fraction of the people who might be interested in this hobby.

From this observation grew the idea to build a project that would make the process super simpleâ€”without relying on proprietary hardware and software like many commercial feeders do. Everything is open source, and the infrastructure is completely agnostic of the aggregators you want to feed.
